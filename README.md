Working of Vector Search:

Sentence embedding and FAISS help in a efficient similarity search in given set of sentenses. 
Vector search is the main working principle behind this.
Vector search is the technique where data is retrieved based on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword match.

Here the sentenses dataset is converted into numerical vector using the model all-minlm-L6-v2.
These vectors has the meaning of the text in a high demensional space.
when a query is issues, it is also embedded into vector form and compared against the stored sentences.
the closest vector are the most relevant results.
